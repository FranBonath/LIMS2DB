What is a Process Category?
============================

In the project-statusdb context, lims processes are categorised into groups that define, or are used to define a certain type of status-db key in a project database. The categories are specified here. 


Adding a work flow.
==========================

If a work flow does not fit with the categories one might have to change the category definitions or ad new categories. This needs to be done in corperation with the developer of project_summary_uppload_LIMS.py. The cathegories are defined in process_categories.py within the objectsDB package.
